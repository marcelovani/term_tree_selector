# Term Tree Selector

Provides configurable root/leaf selector blocks for term trees with 2 or 3 levels.

Terms will only show in the selector if they are published and have content.

## Installation

Once enabled, you can place one or more "Term Tree Selector" blocks
with the following configuration:

**Vocabulary:** The hierarchical vocabulary to use

**Root Label:** The label for the root terms, e.g. "Make", used to
display "Select Make" in the root select box.

**Leaf Label:** The label for the leaf terms, e.g. "Model", used to
display "Select Model" in the leaf select box.

**Leaf Level:** The number levels to traverse to populate the leaf select
box (Second, Third or All). "All" will show the second and third levels.

**Description (optional):** Text that will be displayed above the form

**Submit Label:** The text shown on the submit button

**Auto Submit:** If checked the form will automatically be submitted 
once a leaf has been selected
